# ansible-examples

This repository is for various example playbooks. Each playbook and environment is separated by a logical name and directory. Each directory has a README explaining what the functionality is for that particular playbook, it's requirements and dependencies, and example usage. In most cases there is also a shell script to show example invocation.
